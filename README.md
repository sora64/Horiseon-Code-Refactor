# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

In this project I refactored both the HTML file and the CSS file to be more accessible and opimized for search engines. I renamed various "div" elements in the HTML file to be more semantic/meaningful; in some cases I used the "article" elements to lump various aspects of the webpage together so as to improve the webpage for search engines. I got rid of redunant stylings in the CSS and consolodated others. I added descriptive comments to my code to identify each section and its functionality. I added appropriate "alt" descriptors for images that needed them. I saved my progress using GitHub, and made various changes in the relevant repository as needed.
